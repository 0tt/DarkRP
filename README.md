# DarkRP 2.6.2 is in beta!
Try at your own risk, I changed a lot in the backend, changed a lot of console commands to be both chat commands and concommands. There's a **high risk** of it being buggy! If 2.6.2 is broken for you, please go to the releases tab and download the last revision of 2.6.1.

Please report issues

Please try to use the git protocol instead of SVN to get access to DarkRP. GitHub has a very nice program for it:

If you really can't/don't want to use git, you can still use SVN.
